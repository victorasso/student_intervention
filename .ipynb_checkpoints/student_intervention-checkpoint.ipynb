    "\n",
    "#### Naive Bayes applicability:\n",
    "The emails providers that we use today utilize this method to classify emails as spams and no spams. This model was selected because it utilizes a naive classifier, it utilizes the Bayes rule to get a subset of words from the mail and uses a bag of words previously trainned in the model to take its decision, this will serve as base for the spam / no spam guess as you can see in this article here:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs124/lec/naivebayes.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Naive Bayes strenghts: \n",
    "One of the fastest models available;\n",
    "\n",
    "It takes features independently. In the end, all features contribute to the probability of the output (Naive);\n",
    "\n",
    "Performs better in categorical values;\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Naive Bayes Weaknesses:\n",
    "It doesn't consider records from test data which weren't present in the training data. Proper data treatment could reduce the amount of disconsidered values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Does not perform well in numerical values;\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why it's a good model for this problem:\n",
    "Most of our data is categorical, so we can expect a good performance with a low computational costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Support Vector Machines\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Support Vector Machines applicability:\n",
    "In chemistry, elements tend to have particular characteristics that are integer, such as atomic mass, charge, eletronic spin, etc, the SVM method takes advantage of those clear margins between the features to classify the records utilizing lines, planes and hyperplanes (depending on the record dimensionality) as we can see in this article (page 59), there's a section where they use this algorithm to classify the similarity between sequences of aminoacidis, this is a key point to predict this sequence biological properties.\n",

    "http://www.ivanciuc.org/Files/Reprint/Ivanciuc_Applications_of_Support_Vector_Machines_in_Chemistry.pdf\n",

    "#### Support Vector Machines strenghts:\n",
    "It works better when there's a clear margin between the classifiers;\n",
    "\n",
    "It works well in models with several dimensions;\n",
    "\n",
    "It is effective when there are more dimensions than samples;\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Support Vector Machines weaknesses:\n",
    "It requires a lot of processing to perform;\n",
    "\n",
    "It doesn't perform well when dimensions are overlaping;\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why it's a good model for this problem:\n",
    "Dataset is small, so there is no concern about performance. Therefore, this model would fit if the classes are free from too much noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Random Forest\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Random Forest applicability:\n",
    "Random Forest is the method that creates several classifiers and aggregate its results, this method can be implemented in computer vision to classify parts of the body, it basically generates several different decision trees and once new data comes, the algorithm passes this data in each decision tree, they all take its guess about what part this data is and than we see which part got the most votes. We can see an application of this method in this article:\n",

    "It has a great performance among other algorithms;\n",
    "\n",
    "It runs well enough in large datasets;\n",
    "\n",
    "The overfitting can be reduced by increasing the number of trees;\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Random Forest weaknesses:\n",
    "It can be very sensitive to small perturbations on the data;\n",
    "\n",
    "It's hard to avoid overfitting. Prior analysis are required for that;\n",

    "### Implementation: Model Performance Metrics\n",
    "With the predefined functions above, you will now import the three supervised learning models of your choice and run the `train_predict` function for each one. Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `clf_A`, `clf_B`, and `clf_C`.\n",
    " - Use a `random_state` for each model you use, if provided.\n",
    " - **Note:** Use the default settings for each model — you will tune one specific model in a later section.\n",
    "- Create the different training set sizes to be used to train each model.\n",
    " - *Do not reshuffle and resplit the data! The new training points should be drawn from `X_train` and `y_train`.*\n",
    "- Fit each model with each training set size and make predictions on the test set (9 in total).  \n",
    "**Note:** Three tables are provided after the following code cell which can be used to store your results."

    "**Answer: ** The model that we selected for this problem uses the advantage of the clear separation between the classifiers to take its guesses. For example, imagine that we want to separate 100 red balls from 100 blue balls. Appart from the color, these balls are located in 2 different rooms. In the first scenario, we can see both rooms, so we analyze that 90% of the red balls are in the left room and 10% of the red balls in right room. A moment later, the light of the rooms is turned off, a person comes to you from the left room and another from the right room. Each one of them gives you a ball, and you must choose the ball color without turning the lights on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the previous knowledge you had (when the lights were on) your best guess is that the ball from the left room is red and the other one is blue. You guess that because you have mentally drawn a line between the rooms, using that separation to minimize the errors. Now imagine that apart from that information, you know that the red balls tend to be heavier and the blue balls tend to be lighter. Once you get them in your hands, you can combine the information given (where they came plus their weight) to improve even more your guess.\n",
